Benchmarks

This folder contains C programs designed to benchmark the processor's performance for various operations.

ALU.c: Benchmarks the performance of standard ALU operations in a fixed loop.
    
ALUrand.c: Measures ALU performance with randomized operations.

Arrays.c: Benchmarks the time taken for assigning values to a large array (10000 elements) and copying the contents to another array.

Arrays2.c: A modified version of Arrays.c that uses a 100-element array to reduce cache misses during the test.
