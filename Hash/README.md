Hash

This folder contains the implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in C and a benchmark program to measure its performance.

sha256.c: The core implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm, with functions for initialization, updating data, and finalizing the hash.

sha256.h: The header file for the SHA-256 functions.

hash.c: A benchmark program that measures the time required to hash a string over many iterations. A metric for the hash function.
