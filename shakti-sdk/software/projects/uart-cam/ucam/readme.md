# UCAM_III-driver

A device driver supporting the device UCAM_III camera module.

Sequence of Steps:
1. Supply 5V to the Camera. The power supplied by the board is also enough for camera to work. 
2. Connect the camera to rx tx of UART1.
3. Compile the above code using shakti tools and execute.
4. In the below video recording we are just copy pasting the output to show the working of code , but follow the steps in ucam-test readme to send the image that we got from camera to the PC through UART2.
